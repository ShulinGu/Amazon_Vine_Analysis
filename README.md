## Summary:
  - Amazon invites customers to become Vine Voices based on their reviewer rank, which is a reflection of the quality and helpfulness of their reviews as judged by other Amazon customers. Although there are far less Vine reviews than non-Vine reviews. The percentage of 5 star Vine reviews are higher than that of non-Vine reviews. It seems like bias occurs among the Vine reviews since the total Vine reviews are only 94. Non-Vine reivews show a much realistic value.
  - It is recommended to get the percentage of other star ranking and the mean value of the total star rating so we can figure out if bias really occurs among the Vine reviews.
